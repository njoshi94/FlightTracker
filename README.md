Link to Tableau Dashboard: https://public.tableau.com/profile/nishant8350#!/vizhome/FlightTrackerDashboard/FlightTracker

A flight tracker built with Python and SQL that tracks lowest prices to certain destinations for a specified date range and predicts lowest prices for the following two weeks. 

The tracker scrapes data from Kayak, Google, and Expedia. 

The tracker can make predictions for a fixed date range, as well as predictions for 70-90 days in advance (this date range is believed to be in the optimal range of purchasing tickets)

The dashboard provides the predictions, as well as a more in depth look at flight details for the day.
